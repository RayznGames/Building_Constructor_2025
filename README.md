Rayzngames is NOT the creator of the original Building Constructor Script. 
Credit for original Script goes to -Amirreza Moghaddam

Rayzngames contribution has only fixed major errors, fails, and issues that ocurred 
in newer versions of maya like 2024 onwards.
Making this tool a completely reliable scipt for generating and packaging multiple types of parametric buildings

The building creation process has been made more failproof and wirndow generation 
has been completely fixed and enhanced, allowing for single 0 floor cound buildings
to have windows in all sides.

Window decorations are now all properly working at all floor sizes..

Many aspects have been improved and tested against failure.
However most of the issues that can arise now come down to the building packaging and do not destroy nor break geometry.
Just require some manual parenting/combine work and renaming of the final mesh files.

Enjoy!
