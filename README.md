# Building_Constructor_2025
A Maya script that worked for Maya 2018, that I modified to work with newer versions of Maya 2024+

Rayzngames is NOT the creator of the original Building Constructor Script. 
Credit for the original Script goes to Amirreza Moghaddam

Rayzngames' contribution has only fixed major errors, failures, and issues that occurred 
In newer versions of Maya, like 2024 onwards.
Making this tool a completely reliable script for generating and packaging multiple types of parametric buildings

The building creation process has been made more failproof, and window generation 
has been completely fixed and enhanced, allowing for single 0-floor count buildings
to have windows on all sides.

Window decorations are now all properly working at all floor sizes..

Many aspects have been improved and tested against failure.
However, most of the issues that can arise now come down to the building packaging and do not destroy or break geometry.
It just requires some manual parenting/combine work, along with renaming the final mesh files.

Enjoy!
